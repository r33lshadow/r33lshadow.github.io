## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 1 
This was a fun lab because it was the first time we got to work with linux and C++. The lab itself was pretty straight foward but learning all the linux commands was a challenge. The Syntax of C++ was both a challenge and was enjoyable especially seeing how far we would go after this lab.

Lab 6, part 1
This was another favorite lab of mine mainly for the in person lab portion of this lab. Most of the labs were pretty boring or felt like work when we were doing them. This lab was actually fun to work on in class and having fun with making our sandwich was the first time we felt cool coding in C++.

Lab 10
This was probably my favorite lab because it felt like the first piece of code that could be used in a real world scenario. This made all the C++ learned in the past feel like it was finally coming full circle. Using 2D vectors to return the counties and population felt like "real" code.
